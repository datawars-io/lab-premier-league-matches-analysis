# DataWars: Student Project's example

This is an example of one of DataWar's projects. If you're interested in applying to DataWars as a project writer/education advisor, we're likely going to ask you to build one project similar to this to test your skills.

Here's what you need to know.

### What project you should submit?

Anything you want! This project is based on Data Analysis with Pandas, but you shouldn't restrict to that. Depending on your expertise it can be about R, SQL, Programming in general, using Bash, etc. Check with us first and submit your proposal (just a quick overview of what you're going to build).

### How to build your project

The most important thing about our projects is that we want them to be self-explanatory, and we want them to be "actionable". By actionable we mean based on activities for the student to resolve. We want to give them clear challenges that they have to resolve and answer.
This particular project is based on two types of activities:

##### Multiple choice

See **Task 1** as an example. We ask a question and give the student +4 options to select from. Pretty standard.

##### Open input

See **Task 4** as an example. In this case we just ask them to compute something and provide the answer. In this case, they need to enter "2.66", that's it. For example, if your project is about SQL, you could ask "How many records have the column `active` in 1", and the answer will be just a number.

### Solutions and hints are IMPORTANT

We want to drive learning by providing well crafted solutions that help the student reason about the problem. Check the solution of **Task 2** as an example. We're explaning what are the required steps to reason the problem and arrive to the answer.

### How to submit your project

This project is based on Jupyter Notebooks, and all the student's activities are right in the notebook. Yours doesn't have to be that way. If your experience is with, for example, RStudio, your project can be done with R and RStudio. Or if you're experienced with SQL, your project can be about SQL Queries or desigining a Database.

In those cases, your "submission" can be different. It can be just a zip file containing the Database and a Google Docs with the questions and solutions. It can be a Github repository, etc. As long as you maintain this format of well crafted activities and solutions, we're happy with it!
